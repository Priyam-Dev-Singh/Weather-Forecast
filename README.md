# 🌤️ My Weather App

Hey! This is a **real-time weather app** I built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. It can detect your location 🌍 or let you search any city 🏙️, showing current weather, hourly updates, and a 5-day forecast. The app displays temperature, wind, humidity, visibility, and rain, all with dynamic weather animations 🌧️☀️.

Built for fun and practice, and hosted for free on GitHub Pages 🌐.
